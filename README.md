Dart+Angular
=================

Slides and related code for my talk on Dart+Angular at the ngPittsburgh meetup.

You need to have Dart installed on your machine to run the example, you can find the documenation to download and install it here:
http://www.dartlang.org

To get the application working:
* Clone the repository
* In the terminal, navigate into the root directory for the project
* Run pub get, this will download all the project dependencies
* Run pub serve, this will serve your application locally on the specified port

To test out the application you can do 2 things:
* Open the URL listed in the terminal output in Dartium, this will load run the Dart files directly in the browser VM
* Open the URL listed in your default browser, this will compile the Dart code into JavaScript and run that in the browser
